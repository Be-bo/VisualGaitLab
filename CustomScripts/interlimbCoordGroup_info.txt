Interlimb Coordination - Group
(Last Updated June 2022)

In this script, phase coupling is averaged within one condition/group. 
You can take the Regularity Indices calculated in part A ("Animal"/"Clip" scripts) to compare with other outputs (possibly those in the same project) on a compass graph. 
This will result in six compass graphs for each paw couple.

AUTHORS:
 - Original MATLAB script by Linda Kim
 - Python Adaptation by Zahra Ghavasieh

PARAMETERS (minimum 2):
 1. Output Folder
 2. CSV file output from part A. ([ID]-phaseval.csv)
 3. [opt.] add as many more CSV file outputs from part A as desired.
 ...

EXAMPLE PARAMS:
 - outB 
 - out_test1/test_mouse1-phaseval.csv 
 - out_test2/test_mouse2-phaseval.csv 
 - out_test3/test_mouse3-phaseval.csv

NOTES:
 - Make sure the parameters are in order.
 - You can run this script right after part A by specifying "[outputFolder]/[animalID]-phaseval.csv" as a parameter. For example, "out/testID-phaseval.csv".
